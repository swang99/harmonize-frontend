## Architecture
- [Frontend](https://harmonize-client.onrender.com) [Repo](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-24s/project-client-spotify-sharing):
  - Node.js
  - React
  - Chakra UI - Frontend Components Library
  - Spotify API - Authorization and using data
- [Backend](https://project-api-spotify-sharing.onrender.com) [Repo](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-24s/project-api-spotify-sharing)
  - MongoDB
  - Express

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup
### Frontend:
- Clone Repo, npm install, npm run dev
- In src/store/profile-slice.js, ensure that the ROOT_URL points to whichever backend/DB you want to use (default is the deployed backend).
- To gain access to the Spotify API Client ID (in src/utils/SpotifyAuth.js), ask Brendan to add you to the Spotify API app. Alternatively, [create](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create) a new Spotify API app and set the Redirect URI to the /home page of your Frontend (could be [http://localhost:5173/home](http://localhost:5173/home)) or the deployed url. Select the Web API and Web Playback SDK options.

### Backend:
- Clone Repo, npm install, npm start
- Make sure your frontend is pointing to the correct backend (ROOT_URL in src/store/profile-slice.js of the frontend), should end in /api.

## Deployment (using Render)
### Frontend:
- Create a static site using this repository on Render.
- Use the main branch
- Build Command: npm install && npm run build
- Publish directory: dist
- Make sure the ROOT_URL in src/store/profile-slice.js is pointing at the correct backend (deployed url), and the Redirect URI in the Spotify App is updated to reflect your new deployed frontend URL!

### Backend: 
- Create a web service using the [backend](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-24s/project-api-spotify-sharing) on Render.
- Use the main branch
- Build Command: npm install && npm run build
- Start Command: npm run prod
- Environment Variables: Set MONGODB_URI to link to your MongoDB account.
